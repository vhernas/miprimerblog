Step Two: Clarify Your Marketing Message.
==========

STEP TWO: The Right Engine
==========


Clarify Your Marketing Message Using the StoryBrand Framework
==========


Reviewing and refining your marketing engine is key to increasing thrust and getting the plane off the ground.
==========

Communicating to potential customers that your product will solve a problem they are struggling with and then asking those potential customers to place an order is infinitely more important than putting your logo on swag.
==========

The right engine represents marketing; the left engine represents sales.
==========

Clarify Your Message and Customers Will Listen
==========

to explain what our products have to offer in such clear, simple language that everybody understands why they should buy our products and is motivated to do so.
==========

Sadly, most small businesses think more about how their marketing will look rather than what their marketing will say.
==========


the reason customers place orders is not because a brand design is attractive, it’s because they read or hear words that make them want to place orders.
==========



==========

The truth is our business will grow because we’ve used words that make people want to buy our products. If we don’t know how to talk about our products, our business will not grow.
==========


Due to your words, they will either be drawn into a story in which they play the hero and use your product to solve a problem, or they will find your product uninteresting and move on.
==========

remember two primary ideas: 1. People are only attracted to information that helps them survive and thrive, and 2. People, for the most part, only listen to ideas that are communicated simply.
==========

Your brain filters out nearly everything, processing only the information that will help you survive and thrive.
==========

What do I mean by survive? I mean save money, make money, find rest, feel better, connect with more people, create a memory with loved ones, take care of ourselves, find love, be entertained, rest and recharge, eat, defend ourselves, and so on.
==========


Associate our products with our customers’ survival in such short, simple Soundbites that people don’t have to think too much to understand why they should buy them.
==========

Use Story to Create Short, Simple Soundbites
==========


One of the few things that can make you stop daydreaming for an extended period of time is story.
==========


The same storytelling used in ancient Greece is now used in virtual reality videogaming.
==========

In the first step, you used the Business on a Mission Framework to invite yourself and your team into a story;
==========


now you’ll use the StoryBrand Framework to invite customers into a story that solves their problems and changes their lives.
==========


The StoryBrand Seven-Part Framework
==========


The StoryBrand Framework has been used by more than 700,000 business leaders to clarify their message and generate more thrust in their marketing engine
==========

To clarify your message, use the seven Soundbites that invite customers into a story on your website or landing page, in your lead generators, nurture and sales emails, and presentations.
==========

The StoryBrand Seven-Part Framework looks like this:
==========

StoryBrand Element One: A Character Who Wants Something A story starts when we meet a character who wants something. The hero wants to disarm the bomb. The athlete wants to win the championship. The couple wants to get married.
==========


Will the hero get what they want?
==========


If you’re a marriage counselor, you might be tempted to say something like, “Our clients want to be happy at home,”
==========
M

Instead, you might say something like, “Our clients want to rekindle the love they once shared with their spouse.”
==========
M

The more specific you are, the more likely you are to open a story loop in your customer’s mind.
==========
.

ANSWER THIS QUESTION: What does your customer need from your small business?
==========


StoryBrand Element Two: Must Overcome a Conflict In stories, heroes do not get what they want right away.
==========

Instead of getting what they want right away, heroes have to overcome enormous challenges.
==========

Conflict is what makes a story interesting.
==========

Conflict makes us pay attention to the story.
==========


we’ve got to talk about the problems our customers are dealing with and how our products solve said problems.
==========

ANSWER THIS QUESTION: What are some of the problems your products help your customers overcome?
==========

StoryBrand Element Three: Meets a Guide
==========

Many small-business leaders make the mistake of positioning themselves as the hero in the story. They
==========


What they’re interested in is whether or not you can help them solve a problem.
==========

There are two things you need to do to position yourself as a guide.
==========


The first thing you need to do is express empathy.
==========


Saying things like “We know how it feels to struggle with . . .” goes a long way in positioning you as a guide.
==========


The second thing you need to do to position yourself as a guide is demonstrate authority.
==========


you also have to be able to lead them with competence. Have
==========


you helped hundreds of people overcome the problem your customer is dealing with? Have you created a technology that makes overcoming the challenge easier? Have you won awards for the work you’ve done? What can you say to your customer that will give them confidence you can help them solve their problems?
==========


Statements like “We have helped thousands of people just like you overcome X . . .” or “Our award-winning technology has been featured in dozens of magazines . . .” let customers know you are proficient at solving their problem.
==========


StoryBrand Element Four: Who Gives Them a Plan
==========

There’s no danger in buying your product. You and I know it works. But the customer doesn’t. To us, it’s a sure thing. To them, it’s a risk.
==========


What do you do to help the customer gain more confidence that they won’t be wasting their money?
==========


You place large stones in that river that act as stepping-stones. When the customer sees there is a clear path to cross the river, they become much more likely to place an order.
==========


What we need to provide for the customer is baby steps.
==========


When you give your customer a three- or four-step plan, they are much more likely to place an order.
==========


A plan exists to let the customer know the journey from their problem to your solution will be easy.
==========


Keep the plan easy, and your customer will feel safety and comfort and will start taking steps toward a purchase.
==========

When we offer three or four baby steps to our customers, they’ll feel more comfortable moving ahead.
==========

You can use a three-step plan to sell a pair of shoes: 1) Order the shoes, 2) Try them on at home, 3) Ship them back if they don’t fit.
==========


You can do the same when selling a service: 1) Sign up for our HVAC maintenance program, 2) Get regular checkups and filter replacements, and 3) Never worry about your HVAC system again.
==========


When you present a plan to the customer, you essentially “lift the fog”
==========


three-step plan like this essentially tells the customer what the future looks like if they work with you, lifting the fog.
==========


ANSWER THIS QUESTION: What three or four steps do your customers need to take in order to buy your product and solve their problem?
==========

StoryBrand Element Five: And Calls Them to Action
==========


People don’t tend to do things unless you ask them to do things.
==========

Guides often have to challenge heroes to take action in order to help them resolve their problem.
==========


StoryBrand Element Six: So the Hero Can Avoid Failure A
==========

Will the lawyer win the case and get justice for the entire town, or will all those people continue to suffer?

In a story, the audience is often reminded of what can be won or lost if the hero does or does not take action.
==========


When we remind them that our product keeps them away from frustration and pain, they become more motivated to buy.
==========

What pain or frustration is your product saving your customer from having to experience?
==========


THE QUESTIONS YOU WILL WANT TO ANSWER TO STIMULATE THE RIGHT TALKING POINTS IN THIS SECTION ARE: What negative consequence does my product help my customers avoid?
==========

What will people continue to experience if they do not buy my product or service?
==========

When you include the negative stakes in your marketing collateral, orders will increase.
==========

People are also attracted to the incredible, positive, wonderful things that will happen to them if they do buy our product or service.

Think about it. The bike costs $3K, but you will save some of that in the cost of gas. Also, I’d pay at least $1K to never have to sit in traffic, which means the bike is actually worth $4K, but I’m only paying $3K. I’ll also get to enjoy the outdoors which means I’m getting a $5K value for only $

What the pitches that work have in common, however, is that they invite customers (or voters or stakeholders) into a story in which the customer plays the hero and uses YOUR product to solve a problem in THEIR life. There are no exceptions. These are the pitches that work.

Fixing the proposal so it honored the customer as the hero was easy.

In other words: The proposal identified the customer’s problem, described their product as the solution to that problem, and painted a picture of the better life that was possible once the customer’s problem was resolved. Suddenly we had a million-dollar sales pitch.

Rejection is part of life, and, honestly, it’s of no concern to most successful people. The customer isn’t rejecting you, after all—they’re just saying they don’t have the problem you are able to fix. Great. If they ever do have that problem, now they know who to call. And what’s more, if they have a friend who has that problem, they can refer them to you.

If you want an airplane to fly, make the wings wide, the right and left engines powerful, and the body of the airplane streamlined and light. In other words, if you want your small business to make money, make the marketing and sales engines powerful, make the product profitable, and keep overhead down!

For most small businesses, out-of-control overhead comes from a single place: labor.
==========


Creeping overhead can sink a business. Technology and rent can be expensive, too, but it’s labor that will crash a plane faster than anything else.
==========

If you want to decrease the weight of your airplane and streamline the body, open the emergency doors and start throwing seats into the clouds.
==========

install a Management and Productivity Playbook.
==========


When your labor is focused on your three economic priorities, more money will flow into the business itself.
==========

The best way to decrease the size of the body of your airplane is not to decrease it at all, but to make the rest of the airplane larger while your payroll stays exactly the same (save for commissions for your sales reps and profit-based bonuses, which will hopefully increase).
==========


Optimizing your workflow will increase your profit, energize your team, and increase morale. Also, your customers will get more focused attention, and your products and services will increase in quality.
